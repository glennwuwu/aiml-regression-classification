# Machine Learning Project: Regression and Classification with Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my machine learning project, where I've tackled regression and classification tasks using the power of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm for hyperparameter optimization. This project showcases the effectiveness of ABC in optimizing the performance of various machine learning models.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've created Jupyter Notebook files to demonstrate both regression and classification tasks using popular machine learning algorithms. The key highlight of this project is the integration of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm for hyperparameter optimization. ABC is a bio-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the foraging behavior of bees to find optimal solutions in complex search spaces. It has shown great promise in optimizing machine learning models, and this project explores its potential.

## Key Features

- **Regression Task**: The project includes a Jupyter Notebook file dedicated to regression tasks using the `housing_dataset.csv`. I've utilized popular regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regression. The ABC algorithm is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of these models, enhancing their predictive performance in estimating housing prices based on factors such as location and size.

- **Classification Task**: Another Jupyter Notebook file focuses on classification tasks using the `credit_dataset.csv`. It involves well-known classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier. The ABC algorithm plays a crucial role in optimizing these classifiers for better accuracy in predicting whether a customer will default based on factors such as income and credit history.
